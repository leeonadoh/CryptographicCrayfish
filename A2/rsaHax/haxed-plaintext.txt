<h1>Secrets of Happiness</h1>
<ul>
<li>'It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere.'</li>
<li>'All happiness depends on a leisurely breakfast.'</li>
<li>'If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap.<br/> If you want happiness for a day, go fishing.<br/> If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune.<br/> If you want happiness for a lifetime, help someone else.'</li>
<li>'When one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us.'</li>
<li>'Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.'</li>
<li>'To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness'</li>
<li>'Optimism is a happiness magnet. If you stay positive, good things and good people will be drawn to you.'</li>
<li>'Ice cream is happiness condensed.'</li>
</ul>
